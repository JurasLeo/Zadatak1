                    <p class="fs-4">
                        A food critic, also known as a restaurant critic or food writer, is someone who samples
                        particular foods or restaurants and then provides
                        commentary afterwards regarding all elements relating to the dining experience. These restaurant
                        reviews often include comments on the food quality,
                        taste, and presentation of the food, as well as the ambiance of the restaurant and the service
                        provided by the waitstaff.
                        Food critics are generally expected to know about restaurant openings and closures, and may
                        spend significant time traveling to seek out new flavors.
                        Food journalism can help restaurant owners increase their popularity,
                        but it can also have the opposite effect if certain standards are not met. For this reason, food
                        critics are often anonymous.

                    You Need to Know</span></h2>
            <p class="fs-3 m-5">
                If you’re a foodie, becoming a food critic may sound like a dream job, but it’s a lot more work than
                just going to fancy restaurants. Here’s what you need to know before embarking on a new career as a food
                critic.

            <h2 class="text-centar text-dark">Skills and Salary$?$</h2>
            <p class="fs-3 text-start">
                Though it can depend on the region and your experience,
                food critics generally make an average salary of $80,000–90,000 per year. These are some of the
                necessary skills you need to become a successful food critic:
            </p><br>

            <p class="fs-3 text-start p-5">
                <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-start"> Writing and communication skills</span>: Sharp communication and
                creative writing skills are necessary for a job that entails describing things to people for a living.
                Poor or unclear writing can be confusing to readers, and can even turn them off from reading your work.
                Excellent grammar and communication skills come across as more professional and will be easier to
                understand.
                Being able to craft your review into a compelling story can also help keep readers engaged.<br>
                <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-star">Food knowledge:</span> Food critics need to possess plenty of
                knowledge about a wide variety of different dishes, cuisines, and preparation styles,
                as well as the difference between casual and fine dining. Food critics generally know which flavors and
                textures usually complement one another,
                but are also open to new experiences and tastes. Critics must always be looking to expand their
                palettes, and be able to identify a range of ingredients.<br>
                <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-star">Objectivity:</span> It is important for food writers to be honest
                about their experience without letting other personal matters affect their reviews.
                Dining experiences may differ depending on your own mood, the type of day you’ve had, or how well you’re
                feeling—as well as how the restaurant’s staff is doing on the particular day of the visit.
                When writing about food, it’s important to put any irrelevant feelings aside and give an objective
                critique of the food and atmosphere.
                Most serious food critics will visit a restaurant at least three times before writing a review.<br>
                <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-star">Anonymity:</span> Successful food critics know how to be discreet
                and not call attention to the fact that they are a reviewer.
                Broadcasting your face as the big name in food criticism will not likely get you an honest experience,
                so it’s important for food critics to know how to fly under the radar.

                        <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-start"> 1. Get an education.</span> Receiving your high school
                        diploma or GED and obtaining a bachelor’s
                        degree in a field like creative writing, journalism, or communications can increase your chances
                        of landing a job as a food critic.
                        You can also attend a culinary arts school to expand your knowledge on foods and their many
                        styles of preparation. For a more hands-on education,
                        consider working the line at a restaurant you admire.<br>
                        <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-start">2. Do your research.</span> Research the different
                        expectations and needed skills of a food critic, and be sure to make yourself
                        familiar with cooking terms and restaurant practices, as well as the restaurant industry as a
                        whole. On your own time, try and taste different ingredients
                        to expand your palette and make yourself more knowledgeable. In addition, look up other
                        successful, top food critics and familiarize yourself with their work,
                        as well as their career trajectory.

                        <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-start"> 3. Obtain work experience.</span> You may not obtain a
                        full-time food writing job right out of the gate,
                        but you can start applying for internships or entry-level positions to help get your feet wet.
                        Reach out to good food critics and see if any of them are looking for a
                        mentee, or if they’re willing to share some of their own advice. Alternatively, you can also try
                        to become a freelance restaurant reviewer for different digital publications.<br>
                        <span class="fw-bold fs-2 text-start">4. Put your own work out there. </span>If you’re having
                        trouble landing a food critic job at an existing publication or
                        even becoming a freelancer, you can start your own food blog or website and post your own
                        reviews there. However, even as a casual blogger,
                        it’s important to keep a relatively low profile, as you are much more likely to get an objective
                        view when restaurants don’t know you’re a critic.
